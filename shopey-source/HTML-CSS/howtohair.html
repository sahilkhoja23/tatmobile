              <p>Although it is typical for fine hair to experience the dryness of the Sahara, even the coarsest of curls can be dry, too. Dry hair typically experiences shedding, static, oil build-up around roots, split ends, and difficulty holding volume. Dry hair is often the result of repetitive coloring and daily damage from blow-drying and heat styling.</p>

              <p>Use our Argan Oil Mask Treatment to quench the thirst of your dehydrated hair. Depending on condition of hair, repeat once a week to once every two weeks.</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Apply 1-3 pumps of The Argan Tree Pure Argan Oil Serum into your palm. Extra long or coarse hair may require more.</li>
                  <li>Massage gently into your roots for 2 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Gently work the oil down the shafts of your hair from root to tip.</li>
                  <li>Use 1 more pump of serum to coat split ends.</li>
                  <li>Wrap hair in a hot/warm cloth and leave in for 30 minutes before washing with The Argan Tree Eucalyptus Peppermint Shampoo and Conditioner, which contain avocado oil, honey, shea butter, and keratin which fill gaps in the hair cortex that make it porous and unable to retain moisture.</li>
                  <li>If you have significantly damaged hair, leave the mask on overnight. You can also use 2 pumps of Argan Oil Serum to massage into ends while hair is still wet as a leave-in conditioner. As to not over-moisturize, which can be just as damaging, be sure to only condition on the bottom two-thirds of hair shafts.</li>
                  <li>You can also invest in a wet-comb. Minimize the amount you blow-dry your hair and be sure to use a gentle shampoo to not strip your hair and scalp of necessary moisture. The Argan Tree Shampoo does not lather very much and avoids harsh chemicals for this reason.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="accordionContent"> 
              <p>If you have straight, wavy, or thin hair, you are most likely to experience difficulties maintaining volume. Who doesn’t want vivacious hair full of body? Luckily, there are a few things that can be done to give your hair a healthy bounce that others will envy.</p>
              <p>First, some important information: hair most typically looses volume when it is weighed down by sebum build-up, sulfates, and heavy moisturizes. Washing hair daily can cause your hair to be dry, which in turn causes you to heavily condition, which leads to greasy roots, which results in even more shampooing...and so the vicious cycle continues.</p>
              <p>Ditch shampoos and conditioners with sulfates that strip the scalp of its natural oils. Products infused with essential oils like tea tree and jojoba purify roots and nourish the scalp to maximize volume. Quinoa, rice, and soy proteins thicken hair shafts, making hair appear more full-bodied.</p>
              <p>Invest in the The Argan Tree’s Eucalyptus Peppermint Shampoo and Conditioner, which contain all of these volumizing ingredients as well as Argan oil to maintain moisture, gloss and shine.</p>

              <p>The quest for mermaid hair may seem daunting, and even impossible, but getting (and keeping!) those long, luxurious locks you’ve always wanted is just a few tricks and tips away. The most important thing to note about hair growth is that healthy, strong hair begins at the scalp. Argan oil is rich in vitamin F, which repairs strands and stimulates hair growth</p>

              <p>It is crucial to limit pore-clogging impurities such as dirt, dead skin cells, and sebum around your roots in order to allow our Argan Oil Hair Growth Treatment to penetrate deeply. Repeat the following regimen up to 3 times per week:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Exfoliate the scalp by combining 1 tbsp. of brown sugar, 3 tbsp. of conditioner, and 3 tbsp. of peppermint or tea tree oil into a bowl. Stir ingredients into a paste.</li>
                  <li>Wet hair with warm water.</li>
                  <li>With moderate pressure, massage scrub into roots, along hairline and crown to effectively reach all parts.</li>
                  <li>Rinse with a gentle clarifying shampoo such as our Eucalyptus Peppermint Shampoo, which contains a unique protein blend including keratin, lupine, oat, quinoa, rice, and soy to repair, thicken, and grow hair. It also has sunflower seed oil, which acts as a natural thickening agent with fatty acids that prevent breakage and stimulate growth.</li>
                  <li>Gently pat hair until damp with soft towel.</li>
                  <li>Apply 3 pumps of The Argan Tree’s Pure Argan Oil Serum on your fingertips and massage it gently in slow circular movements into your scalp for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                </ol>

              <p>Curls and coils can be a Catch-22. While some of us struggle with little-to-no volume, other hair types can be over-voluminous, frizzy, and altogether hard to manage. Argan oil is awesome for thick, frizzy curls as it smoothes flyaways and acts as a weightless styling agent.</p>

              <p>Argan Oil Regimen for Curl Definition:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Pump a generous amount of The Argan Tree's Pure Argan Oil Serum into your palm. Apply to a 2-inch section of hair using your palm.</li>
                  <li>Take a damp, warm towel and squeeze hair section, without rubbing. Always start from tip to root.</li>
                  <li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all sections are done.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              
              <p>Argan Oil Regimen to Fight Frizz:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Apply a few pumps of argan oil onto damp, uncombed hair. For hair that is thin, straight, or fine, massage 1 pump of argan oil into palms and work over hair shafts from tips to roots.</li>
                  <li>Wait 10 minutes then start detangling hair with a wet-comb starting from the ends.</li>
                  <li>Stop about 1 inch from roots.</li>
                  <li>Hair can also be frizzy in humid climates, particularly if dry or damaged. Be sure to learn more in the Healthy Hydration section</li>

              <p>Whether it’s a bad breakup, new job, or just an all around need for a drastic change, it is no secret that women turn to altering their hair. A new color can have you feeling more confident than ever, but there’s nothing worse than having that color, and therefore that confidence, fade just a few weeks later. Argan oil is great for pre-color preparation; it creates a barrier from chemical damage and also prevents premature fading.</p>

              <p>Argan Oil Pre-Color Treatment</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The night before coloring, prepare hair by applying a few pumps of The Argan Tree Pure Argan Oil Serum.</li>
                  <li>Leave overnight for deep nourishment.</li>
                  <li>Do not fret if hair seems greasy in the morning, hair color absorbs best when hair is rich with natural oils, and is less likely to feel dry afterward.</li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              
              <p>Argan Oil Post-Color Treatment</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Maintain color by washing with our color-protecting Eucalyptus Peppermint Shampoo. Our shampoo is infused with sunflower seed oil which is rich in beta-carotene, protecting hair from sun damage (the most prevalent cause of color fading).</li>
                  <li>Condition with The Argan Tree Eucalyptus Peppermint Conditioner, which combines avocado oil, honey, shea butter, and argan oil to prevent dehydrated locks due to color treatment chemicals.</li>
                  <li>Rinse with cold water as to not open up the pores in your hair that allow color to leak out.</li>
                  <li>Apply the Argan Oil Serum lightly to hair before the beach or pool to lock in moisture and fight off UVA/UVB rays, dryness of saltwater, and chlorine exposure.</li>
