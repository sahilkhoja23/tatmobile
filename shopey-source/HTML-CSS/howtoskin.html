              <p>AMany body washes can strip the skin of its natural oils and leave it dehydrated, flaky, red, and irritated. Over time, argan oil helps balance the under-production of sebum, which keeps the skin moist and healthy.</p>

              <p>Argan Oil Dry Skin Remedy:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Opt for a gentle cleanser with all-natural ingredients. The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Wash is infused with honey, shea butter, and argan oil to lock in skin’s moisture while simultaneously preventing oil build-up. This leaves skin soft and even in tone and texture.</li>
                  <li>Once out of the shower, gently pat (do not rub!) skin with a soft towel.</li>
                  <li>While skin is still moist, pump The Argan Tree Pure Argan Oil Serum into palm. Depending on the dryness of your skin, you may want to be generous in your application.</li>
                  <li>Rub the Argan oil into your moist skin in circular motions for 1-2 minutes until all dry areas are covered. This ensures maximum absorption.</li>
                  <li>Dry air is one of the most common causes of flaky skin. If you are constantly exposed to cold air conditioning or live in a dry climate, use The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Lotion, which combines a triple threat of cocoa butter, shea butter, and argan oil to maintain touchable, smooth skin. It is lightweight and extremely absorbant.</li>
                  <li>For those who suffer from redness, irritation, and psoriasis, The Argan Tree body lotion also has aloe vera to soothe and heal uncomfortable skin issues.</li>
                </ol>

              <p>Acne can be frustrating and embarrassing, even more so at times if you are an adult. However, many individuals have seen acne relief in the application of Argan oil. You may wonder how an oil could possibly reduce breakouts. Isn’t oil build-up what causes them?</p>
              <p>It is important to note that most acne medications use benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, which can sometimes hurt more than help. Improper use of these ingredients can lead to dry, irritated skin, which can induce the over-production of oil and result in even more blemishes.</p>
              <p>DSwitching to a natural healer like argan oil can balance skin’s moisture and even skin tone. Argan oil is also high in anti–inflammatory components such as anti-oxidants and vitamin E, thereby capable of soothing inflammation and blemishes naturally.</p>
              <p>To enjoy a significant reduction in redness, flakiness, and blemishes, follow our Argan Oil Acne Treatment:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>It is a crucial first step to exfoliate skin 3 times a week to dispose of dead skin cells, sebum build-up, and everyday dirt and debris. Use a gentle exfoliator without harsh granulars to prevent further irritation.</li>
                  <li>Depending on the size of acne-irritated region, apply 1-3 pumps of The Argan Tree Pure Argan Oil Serum to skin using clean fingertips. This is best to perform right after a shower.</li>
                  <li>Apply argan oil in gentle, circular motions.</li>
                  <li>Repeat 2 times a week and gradually increase once your skin is familiarized with the new product.</li>
                  <li>If you suffer from acne marks on the face and body, The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Wash is infused with coffee and ginseng, whose powerful anti-oxidants work to fade the appearance of unwanted scars. The Vitamin E from the argan oil in the body wash also helps repair skin.</li>
                </ol>

              <p>As someone with oily skin, the last thing you probably want to hear is a suggestion to apply even more oil to it. However, argan oil is known for balancing the production of sebum naturally released by the dermis. Sebum is produced to lubricate and protect our skin from the environment; sebum also tends to be overproduced when skin is lacking in moisture. Therefore, the sufficient application of a natural moisturizer is essential to decrease an oily appearance over time.</p>

              <p>To use Argan Oil to Reverse Oily Skin:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Use a gentle exfoliator to cleanse skin of dead cells, dirt, and sebum 3 times per week.</li>
                  <li>During the day, apply only 1 pump of The Argan Tree Pure Argan Oil Serum. You may also chose to skip this step to avoid unwanted shine.</li>
                  <li>At night, apply 2-3 pumps of Argan oil on oily skin. Rub in gentle, circular motions and leave overnight.</li>
                  <li>There is no need for extra cleansing of skin to remove oil in the morning other than your usual shower routine.</li>
                  <li>Use this remedy 2 times per week and increase gradually over time. Also be careful about your diet and choice of makeup, as these can cause unwanted slickness and shine.</li>
                </ol>

              <p>CMany women opt for night creams and collagen treatments to reduce wrinkles. Some women don’t suffer from wrinkles but feel their skin lacks its once-beautiful radiance. It is important to understand what active ingredients can restore the youthful appearance of skin.</p>

              <p>Triterpenoids in argan oil provide anti-inflammatory protection from sun, smoke, and other toxins that damage and dull skin tone. Argan oil also contains sterolins, which increase skin’s metabolism and promote moisture retention; lack of moisture is a prevailing cause of decreased collagen production and wrinkles. Finally, argan oil is rich in Vitamin E, which is widely recognized for its effective anti-aging properties.</p>

              <p>Our Anti-Aging Argan Oil Treatment can return your youthful glow:</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Choose a cleanser that contains natural, powerful anti-aging properties such as coffee, rooibos extract, and honey. These ingredients are rich in anti-oxidants that prevent wrinkles, brighten skin tone, and increase skin elasticity; they can be found in The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Wash.</li>
                  <li>Gently pat (do not rub!) face with a soft towel.</li>
                  <li>Using two fingers, apply 2 pumps of The Argan Tree Pure Argan Oil Serum in circular motions to forehead and areas around eyes and mouth.</li>
                  <li>Repeat Nightly</li>
                  <li>To brighten and even skin tone / texture on the body, look for body lotions that contain green tea, ginseng, and sunflower seed extracts. The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Lotion combines these ingredients for their powerful anti-oxidants that increase skin’s radiance and even it’s texture.</li>

              <p>Having a baby is a beautiful thing, but sometimes, the changes it makes to your body are not. Fluctuations in weight can also lead to unwanted blemishes. Stretch marks and cellulite can be frustrating and seemingly impossible to get rid of. Argan oil is a wonderful natural remedy for these issues, and with some patience, you can enjoy the firm, youthful skin you once had.  </p>

              <p>Argan oil is rich in tocopherols and fatty acids that improve cell regeneration and protect our cells from free radicals’ damage. This means that argan oil not only reduces the appearance of stretch marks, but it also tightens skin and battles cellulite.</p>

              <p>Argan Oil Regimen for Firmer Skin</p>

              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Integrate a body wash into your shower routine that naturally increases skin elasticity. The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Wash is infused with caffeine from white tea, green tea, and coffee to help tighten skin.</li>
                  <li>After the shower, rub a generous amount of The Argan Tree 100% Argan Oil gently and deeply onto areas with stretch marks and cellulite. If you are pregnant, apply to areas where you would expect these issues: waist, hips, thighs, arms, glutes, breasts, and stomach.</li>
                  <li>Continue application 2-3 months after baby or weight gain/loss, until skin has returned to full elasticity. Expect to see results after about 6-8 weeks.</li>
                  <li>The Argan Tree White Tea Lavender Body Lotion contains rice starch, which has been celebrated in Japanese culture for cellulite reduction, collagen products, and anti-aging properties. Opt for this lighter moisturizer during the day if you wish to utilize the Pure Argan Oil Serum as a purely nighttime regime.</li>
